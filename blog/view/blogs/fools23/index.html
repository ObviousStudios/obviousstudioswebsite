            Obvious Studios, a game development company known for its innovative and engaging games, has recently announced that they will be changing their name to Oblivious Studios. This name change comes as a surprise to many fans, but the company has stated that it is a necessary move to better reflect their values and vision for the future. <br>
            <br>
            In this blog post, we will explore the reasons behind this decision, what it means for the company and its fans, and what we can expect from Oblivious Studios in the future.
<br>
First and foremost, the decision to change the name from Obvious to Oblivious stems from the company's desire to break away from the traditional norms and conventions of the gaming industry. As a company that prides itself on innovation and pushing boundaries, they felt that the old name no longer accurately represented who they are and what they stand for.<br>
The word "obvious" has connotations of predictability and lack of creativity, which is the opposite of what Oblivious Studios is striving for. By changing the name to "Oblivious," they hope to signify a commitment to embracing the unknown, exploring uncharted territories, and pushing the limits of what is possible.<br>
<br>
Another reason for the name change is to create a stronger brand identity. As the gaming industry becomes increasingly crowded and competitive, it is more important than ever to stand out from the crowd. The new name, Oblivious Studios, is unique and memorable, and it will help the company to differentiate itself from its competitors.<br>
<br>
The new name also reflects the company's commitment to inclusivity and diversity. The word "oblivious" can be interpreted in different ways, but one of its meanings is "unaware." This can be seen as a nod to the importance of being aware of and sensitive to different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. By choosing a name that is open to interpretation, the company is signaling that they are committed to creating games that are accessible and inclusive to all.<br>
<br>
Of course, changing a company name is not a decision to be taken lightly, and there are risks involved. The most significant risk is the potential for confusion among fans and customers. Many people may still refer to the company as Obvious Studios, which could lead to a loss of brand recognition and identity.<br>
<br>
However, the company is aware of this risk and has taken steps to mitigate it. They have launched a comprehensive marketing campaign to introduce the new name to their audience and make sure that everyone is aware of the change. They have also updated their website, social media profiles, and other online platforms to reflect the new name.<br>
<br>
Despite these risks, the benefits of the name change are clear. It will help the company to better represent their values and vision, create a stronger brand identity, and signal a commitment to inclusivity and diversity. It is a bold move, but one that is in line with the company's ethos of innovation and pushing boundaries.<br>
<br>
So what can we expect from Oblivious Studios in the future? While the name may be changing, the company's focus on creating innovative and engaging games remains the same. They have several exciting projects in the works, including a new action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world, and a puzzle game that uses virtual reality technology to create an immersive and interactive experience.<br>
<br>
The company is also exploring new ways to engage with their audience, including live streams, social media campaigns, and interactive events. They believe that building a strong community around their games is essential to their success, and they are committed to fostering a positive and inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, the decision to change the name from Obvious to Oblivious is a bold move, but one that is in line with the company's ethos of innovation and pushing boundaries. It will help the company to better represent their values<br>
